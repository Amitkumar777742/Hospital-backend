# Hospital Management System

A full-stack hospital management system built using React.js for the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend. This system allows healthcare professionals to manage patient data, appointments, medical records, and more, with secure user authentication and a responsive user interface.

## Features

### Frontend:
- Manage patient data (view, add, update, delete)
- Appointment scheduling and management
- View and update medical records
- User authentication (login/signup)
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

### Backend:
- CRUD operations for patients, appointments, and medical records
- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access (admin, doctor, patient)
- API to handle all data interactions with MongoDB

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, React Router, Material UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing
- **Environment Configuration**: dotenv
